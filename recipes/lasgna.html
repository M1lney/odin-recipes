    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>The Beef Ragu</h3>
    <p>We start by frying onion in a pan with a little oil. Add garlic, carrot and finely chopped mushrooms (this bulks out the dish and adds flavour). Once softened, add in the minced beef and brown in the pan, then add in tomato puree, oregano, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, a crumbled stock cube, tinned tomatoes, a little brown sugar and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Stir, bring to the boil and simmer for 15 minutes while you make the béchamel sauce.</p>
    <h3>Béchamel Sauce (or white sauce)</h3>
    <p>The white sauce for lasagne is called béchamel sauce.
        To make the béchamel sauce, melt butter in a saucepan, then stir in flour to form a paste.
        Slowly stir in milk, and keep stirring (using a hand whisk) over the heat until thickened. Stir in cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper and turn off the heat.</p>
    <h3>Assemble the Lasagne</h3>
    <p>Now take your lasagne dish and spread a little of the meat sauce over the base of the dish. You don't need a lot it's just to stop the lasagne sheets from sticking to the base of the dish. Top with lasagne sheets (try not to overlap, but we don't want big spaces either). Then top with a third of the béchamel, followed by a third of the meat sauce. Repeat twice more - lasagne ->béchamel->meat sauce->lasagne->béchamel->meat sauce. Then sprinkle on the cheese and place in a preheated oven at 200C/400F for 25 - 30 minutes, until the cheese is golden.</p>
